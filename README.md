Slowly getting to grips with 3D printer and putting it together. I've just managed to put together the first 3 joints and the servos for the first 2 degrees of freedom:

Created a 3d model of the robot and used what it seems to be the standard for their simulations. At a first glance it looks medieval compared to multibody simulations in other industries.
